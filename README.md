# Fmethod: The FACET-II Beam Stabilization Algorithm

This is a beam stabilization algorithm implemented to mitigate the effects of slow drift on the FACET-II laser transport. 

https://facet.slac.stanford.edu

We have accomplished this by simulating the FACET-II beamline using ZEMAX, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemax, testing a first-principle model of laser transport implemented using Lasers by Siegman as well as research papers on Ray Tracing Optics:

For Simulations, we rely ZEMAX's python API libraries, and MATLAB to design, implement, and optimize the controller. From these results, we have built a two-mirror-two-camera system to test the effectiveness of this method against experimental data.  In order to this, a PID-controller was implemented.

This controller was implemented using SLAC's code base to interact and control cameras and pico-motors present on the transport:
