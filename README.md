# Fmethod: The FACET-II Beam Stabilization Algorithm

This is a beam stabilization algorithm implemented to mitigate the effects of slow drift on the FACET-II laser transport.

We have accomplished this by simulating the FACET-II beamline using ZEMAX, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemax, testing a first-principle model of laser transport implemented using Lasers by Siegman as well as research papers on Ray Tracing Optics:

For Simulations, we rely ZEMAX's python API libraries, and MATLAB to design, implement, and optimize the controller. From these results, we have built a two-mirror-two-camera system to test the effectiveness of this method against experimental data.  In order to this, a PID-controller was implemented.

This controller was implemented using SLAC's code base to interact and control cameras and pico-motors present on the transport:

# Currently working on: 

1. Improving tuning parameters. 
2. Improving code's efficiency with respect to noise present in experiment. 
3. Adding safeguards to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. 
4. Implementing this algorithm on the FACET-II beamline to test its effectiveness on the intended experimental setup.

#Still on the list before end of fellowship: 

The current system experiences severe coupling issues. Currently working on adding decoupling capabilities to the algorithm. It still aligns and keeps the beam on a given target position but it does so by following a parabolic trajectory rather than a linear trajectory.
